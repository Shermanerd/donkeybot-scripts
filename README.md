# What is DonkeyBot?

A customized version of the bot framework built by Github: http://hubot.github.com

# What are these scripts?

Each script responds to something heard in IRC, a command, or an event. Some of the scripts here were originally
built by other folks, but I've customized and improved them here to meet my needs. Feel free to take what you see.
