# What is Hubot?

An awesome IRC bot framework built by Github: http://hubot.github.com

# What are these scripts?

All of these scripts can be placed in your hubot's scripts directory to be loaded the next time it starts up.
Each script responds to something heard in IRC, a command, or an event. Some of the scripts here were originally
built by other folks, but I've customized and improved them here to meet my needs. Feel free to take what you see.
